# Genre Classification using CNN on IMDb Dataset

## üìå **Project Overview**
This project focuses on classifying movie genres using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. The dataset is derived from IMDb, containing movie titles, descriptions, and genres. The primary objective is to build an effective genre classification model using deep learning.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Objectives**
- Perform data preprocessing and text cleaning.
- Implement a CNN model for text classification.
- Achieve high accuracy using efficient deep learning techniques.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics.

---

## üìÅ **Dataset Overview**
The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle - Genre Classification Dataset IMDb](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb).

The dataset consists of four files:
- **`train_data.txt`**: Contains the training data with columns - `ID`, `Title`, `Genre`, and `Description`.
- **`test_data.txt`**: Contains test data with `ID`, `Title`, and `Description`.
- **`description.txt`**: Dataset description.
- **`test_data_solution.txt`**: Contains the actual genres for test data.

### **Data Format**
- **Train Data**: `ID ::: TITLE ::: GENRE ::: DESCRIPTION`
- **Test Data**: `ID ::: TITLE ::: DESCRIPTION`

## üßë‚Äçüíª **Code Overview**

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
    - Reads data using Pandas.
    - Normalizes text (lowercasing).
    - Encodes labels using `LabelEncoder`.
2. **Tokenization and Padding**
    - Converts text into sequences using `Tokenizer`.
    - Pads sequences to ensure uniform input size.
3. **Model Building**
    - A CNN model with Conv1D and GlobalMaxPooling1D layers.
    - Fully connected Dense layers for classification.
4. **Training**
    - Trains the model using `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` as the loss function.
5. **Evaluation**
    - Evaluates training accuracy using `model.evaluate()`.
